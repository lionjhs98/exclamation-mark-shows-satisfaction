## Introduction

For "Recipes and Rating", we have two data sets, "Interactions" & "Recipes". "Recipes" dataset contains recipe name and information of the recipe such as nutrition, how much time it takes to make, how many steps it requires, etc. "Interactions" dataset contains reviews and ratings of each recipe.

When Zichen and Hyunsoo are looking for try to cook some new food, they tend to look up the reviews from food.com, the website where they usually get the data from. But, the problem is that the website has too many recipes and they do not have time to read and try all of them. They usually get a lot of information from the reviews,descriptions and ratings of the food. They only want to try the recipes that got at least 4 stars. One day, Hyunsoo wonders if emotional expressions(existance of exclamation mark) in reviews and descriptions has a connection to the recipe ratings.
They decided to investgate if there is a connection or not with the question below:

### Does the usage of exclamation mark ! in the review and description give the recipes higer rating?

## Hypothesis Testing

### Does the usage of exclamation mark ! in the review and description give the recipes higer rating?

#### Hypothesis Testing Method : Permuations test

###### We will set up Significance Level at 1% (0.01)

#### Null Hypothesis :  In the data, ratings of recipes with exclamation mark in the review & description and recipes without exclamation mark in the review & description have the same distribution. Exclamation mark is not related to the ratings.

#### Alternative Hypothesis : In the data, ratings of recipes with exclamation mark in the review & description has higher rating than recipes without exclamation mark in the review & description. Rating depends on the existence of exclamation mark.
